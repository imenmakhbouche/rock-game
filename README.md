Rock-Game

A simple “Rock, Scissors, Paper” game built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
 
This project lets a user play Rock-Paper-Scissors (or Rock-Scissors-Paper) against the computer.  
The computer randomly chooses a move, and the result is shown to the user (win / lose / draw).  
It’s a small interactive web game to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JS.  

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or open via Live Server).  
2. Choose one of the options: Rock / Scissors / Paper.  
3. The computer will randomly choose its move, and you’ll see the result.  
4. You can play again by refreshing the page or by using any “Reset” or “Play again” button (if implemented).
